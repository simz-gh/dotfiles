# If ble/contrib/integration/fzf cannot find the fzf directory, please set the
# following variable "_ble_contrib_fzf_base" manually.  The value
# "/path/to/fzf-directory" should be replaced by a path to the fzf directory
# such as "$HOME/.fzf" or "/usr/share/fzf" that contain
# "shell/{completion,key-bindings}.bash" or "{completion,key-bindings}.bash".

#_ble_contrib_fzf_base=/path/to/fzf-directory


# Note: If you would like to combine fzf-completion with bash_completion, you
# need to load bash_completion earlier than fzf-completion.

#source /path/to/bash_completion.sh


# Set up fzf
ble-import -d integration/fzf-completion
ble-import -d integration/fzf-key-bindings
